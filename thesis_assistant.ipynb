        "## Proposed RL Agent State Structure\n",
        "\n",
        "This outlines a potential structure for the State that the Reinforcement Learning agent (overseeing project evolution and ethics) would observe. This state combines information from the Ethics Module with broader thesis progress details.\n",
        "\n",
        "The state would likely be represented as a numerical vector or a structured object that the RL model can process.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Components of the State:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Ethical State Features (from Ethics Module):**\n",
        "    *   **AI Detection Score:** The score from the `detect_ai` function for the most recent generated content (e.g., a value between 0 and 1).\n",
        "    *   **Prompt Classification:** A categorical or numerical representation of the last prompt's ethical classification (e.g., 0 for ethical, 1 for structural, 2 for skeptical/dangerous).\n",
        "    *   **Usage Frequency:** Metrics on recent LLM usage (e.g., number of LLM interactions in the last hour/day, proportion of \"generate\" prompts).\n",
        "    *   **Embedding Similarity:** The similarity score from `find_similar_usage` when querying the current prompt against past usage logs (e.g., the distance to the most similar ethical/skeptical past interaction).\n",
        "    *   **Ethical Alert Status:** Flags indicating if any ethical violations or warnings are currently active (e.g., binary flags for over-reliance alert, academic dishonesty alert).\n",
        "    *   **Human Engagement:** Metrics on user interaction with previous ethical interventions (e.g., did the user rephrase AI content, did they engage with a reflection prompt).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Thesis Progress Features:**\n",
        "    *   **Current Thesis Stage:** A categorical or numerical representation of the current stage of the thesis (e.g., 0 for planning, 1 for literature review, 2 for methodology, 3 for writing, etc.).\n",
        "    *   **Task Completion:** Percentage of planned tasks completed for the current stage or overall project.\n",
        "    *   **Time-based Metrics:** Time spent on the project recently, time remaining until deadlines.\n",
        "    *   **Advisor Feedback Status:** A flag or metric indicating the presence and recency of unaddressed advisor feedback.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Performance Features:**\n",
        "    *   **Work Quality Score:** A metric representing the quality of recent thesis work (this would be challenging to define and might require human evaluation or proxy metrics).\n",
        "    *   **Progress Rate:** A measure of how quickly tasks are being completed or milestones are being reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Combining the State:**\n",
        "\n",
        "These individual features would be combined into a single state representation that the RL agent's model can process. For a neural network-based RL model, this would typically be a flattened numerical vector. Categorical features would need to be appropriately encoded (e.g., one-hot encoding).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps for Implementation (for later):**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Define the specific numerical or categorical representation for each state feature.\n",
        "*   Develop the logic within the thesis assistant to collect and compile this information into the state vector at each time step.\n",
        "*   Ensure the Ethics Module submodules (Usage_Logger, AI_Detector, etc.) are providing the necessary data points in a format that can be easily integrated into the state."
